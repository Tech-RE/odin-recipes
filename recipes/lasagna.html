<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. 
    You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, 
    but let's go over the basics: 
</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 olive oil, plus a little for the dish</li>
    <li>750g lean beef mince</li>
    <li>90g pack prosciutto</li>
    <li>800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce</li>
    <li>200ml hot beef stock</li>
    <li>Nutmeg</li>
    <li>300g fresh lasagne sheets</li>
    <li>white sauce</li>
    <li>125g ball mozzarella, torn into thin strips</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol type="1">
    <li>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince<br>
         in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.</li>
    <li>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.</li>
    <li>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock.<br>
         Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.</li>
    <li>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.</li>
    <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).</li>
    <li>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack.<br>
         Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.</li>
    <li>Repeat until you have three layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce,<br>
         making sure you canâ€™t see any pasta poking through.</li>
    <li>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</li>
    <li>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.</li>
    
</ol>
